## General Tips

-   Do your reading!
-   Think about your reading!
    -   "Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for
        granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and
        consider." [*Francis
        Bacon*](http://www.bartleby.com/3/1/50.html)
    -   Almost all books have pros; almost all books have cons.

-   Time yourself!
	-	How long does it take you to read X pages?
    -   Start early enough to know how long a book will take.

-   Use These Tips with Care!
    -   Different disciplines and documents require different kinds of
        reading. <!--These are geared towards humanities classes-->

# Conversational Reading

## A Book is Part of a Conversation ...

-   Between you and the author
-   Between the author and other authors
-   Between you, your professor, and your classmates

## Your Goal as a Reader?

-   Enter the conversation
-   Place the book or article in its larger context
-   Assess the author's argument
-   ~~Memorize every detail~~
    <!--In most humanities and social science courses, the goal is not to memorize everything, but to know what's important in the context of the conversation.-->

# Pre-Reading

## How to Skim

-   Collect information from all the book's titles
-   Read through once like a writer
    -   Where do you put your main points when you write?
    -   Look for main points *early* and *late* ...
    -   In the book, in chapters, in sections, in paragraphs

-   Come back to difficult parts later

> *In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through
> without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things that you do not
> understand right away.* Pay attention to what you can understand and
> do not be stopped by what you cannot immediately grasp. Go right on
> reading past the point where you have difficulties in understanding,
> and you will soon come to things you do understand. Concentrate on
> these. Keep on in this way. Read the book through, undeterred and
> undismayed by the paragraphs, footnotes, comments, and references that
> escape you. If you let yourself get stalled, if you allow yourself to
> be tripped up by any one of these stumbling blocks, you are lost. In
> most cases, you will not be able to puzzle the thing out by sticking
> to it. You will have a much better chance of understanding it on a
> second reading, but that requires you to have read the book through at
> least once.

# The point of skimming and pre-reading is to formulate questions and hypotheses about what the author will say.

# The Slow Read

## As you read ...

-   Be on the look-out for reasons and evidence
-   Ask yourself questions about the author's reasons
-   *Selectively* annotate with marginal notes or high-lights
-   Pause at the end of each section to review and jot notes

# The Post-Read

## While reviewing your notes ...

-   Evaluate the author's claims
-   Prepare a few points you could make in class
-   See what other readers have said about the book
    -   The library's [OneSearch
        tool](http://library.rice.edu/guide/onesearch.html/) often has
        links to reviews
