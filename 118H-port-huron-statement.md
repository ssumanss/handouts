    students led by Tom Hayden and adopted at a convention held
    in Port Huron, Michigan, just over 50 years ago. The text that

We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort,
housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we
inherit.

When we were kids the United States was the wealthiest and strongest
country in the world; the only one with the atom bomb, the least scarred
by modern war, an initiator of the United Nations that we thought would
distribute Western influence throughout the world. Freedom and equality
for each individual, government of, by, and for the people---these
American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men.
Many of us began maturing in complacency.

As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling
to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human
degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry,
compelled most of us from silence to activism.^[The authors refer here to the Civil Rights Movement.] Second, the enclosing
fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought
awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract
"others" we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at
any time.^[The Bomb refers to nuclear weapons.] We might deliberately ignore, or avoid, or fail to feel all
other human problems, but not these two, for these were too immediate
and crushing in their impact, too challenging in the demand that we as
individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution.

While these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled
our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see
complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The
declaration "all men are created equal..." rang hollow before the facts
of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The
proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its
economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.

We witnessed, and continue to witness, other paradoxes. With nuclear
energy whole cities can easily be powered, yet the dominant
nation-states seem more likely to unleash destruction greater than that
incurred in all wars of human history. Although our own technology is
destroying old and creating new forms of social organization, men still
tolerate meaningless work and idleness. While two-thirds of mankind
suffers under nourishment, our own upper classes revel amidst
superfluous abundance. Although world population is expected to double
in forty years, the nations still tolerate anarchy as a major principle
of international conduct and uncontrolled exploitation governs the
sapping of the earth's physical resources. Although mankind desperately
needs revolutionary leadership, America rests in national stalemate, its
goals ambiguous and tradition-bound instead of informed and clear, its
democratic system apathetic and manipulated rather than "of, by, and for
the people."

Not only did tarnish appear on our image of American virtue, not only
did disillusion occur when the hypocrisy of American ideals was
discovered, but we began to sense that what we had originally seen as
the American Golden Age was actually the decline of an era. The
worldwide outbreak of revolution against colonialism and imperialism,
the entrenchment of totalitarian states, the menace of war,
overpopulation, international disorder, supertechnology---these trends
were testing the tenacity of our own commitment to democracy and freedom
and our abilities to visualize their application to a world in upheaval.

Our work is guided by the sense that we may be the last generation in
the experiment with living. But we are a minority---the vast majority of
our people regard the temporary equilibriums of our society and world as
eternally functional parts. In this is perhaps the outstanding paradox;
we ourselves are imbued with urgency, yet the message of our society is
that there is no viable alternative to the present. Beneath the
reassuring tones of the politicians, beneath the common opinion that
America will "muddle through," beneath the stagnation of those who have
closed their minds to the future, is the pervading feeling that there
simply are no alternatives, that our times have witnessed the exhaustion
not only of Utopias, but of any new departures as well. Feeling the
press of complexity upon the emptiness of life, people are fearful of
the thought that at any moment things might be thrust out of control.
They fear change itself, since change might smash whatever invisible
framework seems to hold back chaos for them now. For most Americans, all
crusades are suspect, threatening. The fact that each individual sees
apathy in his fellows perpetuates the common reluctance to organize for
change. The dominant institutions are complex enough to blunt the minds
of their potential critics, and entrenched enough to swiftly dissipate
or entirely repel the energies of protest and reform, thus limiting
human expectancies. Then, too, we are a materially improved society, and
by our own improvements we seem to have weakened the case for further
change.

Some would have us believe that Americans feel contentment amidst
prosperity---but might it not better be called a glaze above deeply felt
anxieties about their role in the new world? And if these anxieties
produce a developed indifference to human affairs, do they not as well
produce a yearning to believe that there *is* an alternative to the
present, that something *can* be done to change circumstances in the
school, the workplaces, the bureaucracies, the government? It is to this
latter yearning, at once the spark and engine of change, that we direct
our present appeal. The search for truly democratic alternatives to the
present, and a commitment to social experimentation with them, is a
worthy and fulfilling human enterprise, one which moves us and, we hope,
others today. On such a basis do we offer this document of our
convictions and analysis: as an effort in understanding and changing the
conditions of humanity in the late twentieth century, an effort rooted
in the ancient, still unfulfilled conception of man attaining
determining influence over his circumstances of life.

Values
------

Making values explicit---an initial task in establishing alternatives--is
an activity that has been devalued and corrupted. The conventional moral
terms of the age, the politician moralities---"free world," "people's
democracies"--reflect realities poorly, if at all, and seem to function
more as ruling myths than as descriptive principles. But neither has our
experience in the universities brought us moral enlightenment. Our
professors and administrators sacrifice controversy to public relations;
their curriculums change more slowly than the living events of the
world; their skills and silence are purchased by investors in the arms
race; passion is called unscholastic. The questions we might want
raised---what is really important? can we live in a different and better
way? if we wanted to change society, how would we do it?---are not
thought to be questions of a "fruitful, empirical nature," and thus are
brushed aside.^[In the 1950s, many universities accepted research contracts
focused on aiding in the fight against communism.]

Unlike youth in other countries we are used to moral leadership being exercised
and moral dimensions being clarified by our elders. But today, for us, not even
the liberal and socialist preachments of the past seem adequate to the forms of
the present. Consider the old slogans: Capitalism Cannot Reform Itself,^[This
phrase was used by W. E. B. DuBois in his 1961 application to join the
Communist Party USA.] United Front Against Fascism,^[Leon Trotsky coined this
phrase to refer to Communists' desire to unite all workers together in
collective struggle, particularly against the fascists of the World War II
period.] General Strike, All Out on May Day. Or, more recently, No Cooperation with Commies and Fellow
Travelers, Ideologies Are Exhausted,^[A term associated with the work of
sociologist Daniel Bell, who suggested that both liberalism and communism were
outdated ideologies in the postwar world.] Bipartisanship, No Utopias. These
are incomplete, and there are few new prophets. It has been said that our
liberal and socialist predecessors were plagued by vision without program,
while our own generation is plagued by program without vision. All around us
there is astute grasp of method, technique---the committee, the ad hoc group,
the lobbyist, the hard and soft sell, the make, the projected image---but, if
pressed critically, such expertise in incompetent to explain its implicit
ideals. It is highly fashionable to identify oneself by old categories, or by
naming a respected political figure, or by explaining "how we would vote" on
various issues.

Theoretic chaos has replaced the idealistic thinking of old---and, unable
to reconstitute theoretic order, men have condemned idealism itself.
Doubt has replaced hopefulness---and men act out a defeatism that is
labeled realistic. The decline of utopia and hope is in fact one of the
defining features of social life today. The reasons are various: the
dreams of the older left were perverted by Stalinism and never
re-created;^[Stalinism refers to the authoritarian dictator Josef Stalin, who presided over violent purges of his opponents in the Communist Party in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s.] the congressional stalemate makes men narrow their view of
the possible;^[The authors likely refer to the inability of Congress to made advances on social welfare and civil rights legislation, despite Democratic control of both chambers.] the specialization of human activity leaves little room
for sweeping thought; the horrors of the twentieth century symbolized in
the gas ovens and concentration camps and atom bombs, have blasted
hopefulness. To be idealistic is to be considered apocalyptic, deluded.
To have no serious aspirations, on the contrary, is to be
"tough-minded."

In suggesting social goals and values, therefore, we are aware of
entering a sphere of some disrepute. Perhaps matured by the past, we
have no formulas, no closed theories---but that does not mean values are
beyond discussion and tentative determination. A first task of any
social movement is to convince people that the search for orienting
theories and the creation of human values is complex but worthwhile. We
are aware that to avoid platitudes we must analyze the concrete
conditions of social order. But to direct such an analysis we must use
the guideposts of basic principles. Our own social values involve
conceptions of human beings, human relationships, and social systems.

We regard *men* as infinitely precious and possessed of unfulfilled
capacities for reason, freedom, and love. In affirming these principles
we are aware of countering perhaps the dominant conceptions of man in
the twentieth century: that he is a thing to be manipulated, and that he
is inherently incapable of directing his own affairs. We oppose the
depersonalization that reduces human being to the status of things---if
anything, the brutalities of the twentieth century teach that means and
ends are intimately related, that vague appeals to "posterity" cannot
justify the mutilations of the present. We oppose, too, the doctrine of
human incompetence because it rests essentially on the modern fact that
men have been "competently" manipulated into incompetence---we see little
reason why men cannot meet with increasing the skill the complexities
and responsibilities of their situation, if society is organized not for
minority, but for majority, participation in decision-making.

Men have unrealized potential for self-cultivation, self-direction,
self-understanding, and creativity. It is this potential that we regard
as crucial and to which we appeal, not to the human potentiality for
violence, unreason, and submission to authority. The goal of man and
society should be human independence: a concern not with image of
popularity but with finding a meaning in life that is personally
authentic; a quality of mind not compulsively driven by a sense of
powerlessness, nor one which unthinkingly adopts status values, nor one
which represses all threats to its habits, but one which has full,
spontaneous access to present and past experiences, one which easily
unites the fragmented parts of personal history, one which openly faces
problems which are troubling and unresolved; one with an intuitive
awareness of possibilities, an active sense of curiosity, an ability and
willingness to learn.

This kind of independence does not mean egotistic individualism---the
object is not to have one's way so much as it is to have a way that is
one's own. Nor do we deify man---we merely have faith in his potential.

*Human relationships* should involve fraternity and honesty. Human
interdependence is contemporary fact; human brotherhood must be willed,
however, as a condition of future survival and as the most appropriate
form of social relations. Personal links between man and man are needed,
especially to go beyond the partial and fragmentary bonds of function
that bind men only as worker to worker, employer to employee, teacher to
student, American to Russian.

Loneliness, estrangement, isolation describe the vast distance between
man and man today. These dominant tendencies cannot be overcome by
better personnel management, nor by improved gadgets, but only when a
love of man overcomes the idolatrous worship of things by man. As the
individualism we affirm is not egoism, the selflessness we affirm is not
self-elimination. On the contrary, we believe in generosity of a kind
that imprints one's unique individual qualities in the relation to other
men, and to all human activity. Further, to dislike isolation is not to
favor the abolition of privacy; the latter differs from isolation in
that it occurs or is abolished according to individual will.

We would replace power rooted in possession, privilege, or circumstance
by power and uniqueness rooted in love, reflectiveness, reason, and
creativity. As a social system we seek the establishment of a democracy
of individual participation, governed by two central aims: that the
individual share in those social decisions determining the quality and
direction of his life; that society be organized to encourage
independence in men and provide the media for their common
participation.

In a participatory democracy, the political life would be based in
several root principles:

> that decision-making of basic social
> consequence be carried on by public groupings;
>
> that politics be seen positively, as the art of collectively creating
> an acceptable pattern of social relations;
>
> that politics has the function of bringing people out of isolation and
> into community, thus being a necessary, though not sufficient, means
> of finding meaning in personal life;
>
> that the political order should serve to clarify problems in a way
> instrumental to their solution; it should provide outlets for the
> expression of personal grievance and aspiration; opposing views should
> be organized so as to illuminate choices and facilitate the attainment
> of goals; channels should be commonly available to relate men to
> knowledge and to power so that private problems---from bad recreation
> facilities to personal alienation---are formulated as general issues.

The economic sphere would have as its basis the principles:

> that work should involve incentives worthier than money or survival.
> It should be educative, not stultifying; creative, not mechanical;
> self-directed, not manipulated, encouraging independence, a respect
> for others, a sense of dignity, and a willingness to accept social
> responsibility, since it is this experience that has crucial influence
> on habits, perceptions and individual ethics;
>
> that the economic experience is so personally decisive that the
> individual must share in its full determination;
>
> that the economy itself is of such social importance that its major
> resources and means of production should be open to democratic
> participation and subject to democratic social regulation.

Like the political and economic ones, major social
institutions---cultural, educational, rehabilitative, and others---should
be generally organized with the well-being and dignity of man as the
essential measure of success.

In social change or interchange, we find violence to be abhorrent
because it requires generally the transformation of the target, be it a
human being or a community of people, into a depersonalized object of
hate. It is imperative that the means of violence be abolished and the
institutions---local, national, international---that encourage
non-violence as a condition of conflict be developed.

These are our central values, in skeletal form. It remains vital to
understand their denial or attainment in the context of the modern
world.

The Students
------------------

In the last few years, thousands of American students demonstrated that
they at least felt the urgency of the times. They moved actively and
directly against racial injustices, the threat of war, violations of
individual rights of conscience, and, less frequently, against economic
manipulation. They succeeded in restoring a small measure of controversy
to the campuses after the stillness of the McCarthy period. They
succeeded, too, in gaining some concessions from the people and
institutions they opposed, especially in the fight against racial
bigotry.

The significance of these scattered movements lies not in their success
or failure in gaining objectives---at least, not yet. Nor does the
significance lie in the intellectual "competence" or "maturity" of the
students involved---as some pedantic elders allege. The significance is
in the fact that students are breaking the crust of apathy and
overcoming the inner alienation that remain the defining characteristics
of American college life.

If student movements for change are still rarities on the campus scene,
what is commonplace there? The real campus, the familiar campus, is a
place of private people, engaged in their notorious "inner emigration."
It is a place of commitment to business-as-usual, getting ahead, playing
it cool. It is a place of mass affirmation of the Twist, but mass
reluctance toward the controversial public stance.^[The Twist was a popular
dance popularized by the rock-and-roll musician Chubby Checker in 1960.] Rules are accepted as
"inevitable," bureaucracy as "just circumstances," irrelevance as
"scholarship," selflessness as "martyrdom," politics as "just another
way to make people, and an unprofitable one, too."

Almost no students value activity as citizens. Passive in public, they
are hardly more idealistic in arranging their private lives: Gallup
concludes they will settle for "low success, and won't risk high
failure."^[Gallup is a polling company that must have conducted a
recent survey of college students, cited here by the authors.] There is not much willingness to take risks (not even in
business), no setting of dangerous goals, no real conception of personal
identity except one manufactured in the image of others, no real urge
for personal fulfillment except to be almost as successful as the very
successful people. Attention is being paid to social status (the quality
of shirt collars, meeting people, getting wives or husbands, making
solid contacts for later on); much, too, is paid to academic status
(grades, honors, the med school rat race). But neglected generally is
real intellectual status, the personal cultivation of the mind.

"Students don't even give a damn abut the apathy," one has said. Apathy
toward apathy begets a privately constructed universe, a place of
systematic study schedules, two nights each week for beer, a girl or
two, and early marriage; a framework infused with personality, warmth,
and under control, no matter how unsatisfying otherwise.

Under these conditions university life loses all relevance to some. Four
hundred thousand of our classmates leave college every year.

The accompanying "let's pretend" theory of student extracurricular
affairs validates student government as a training center for those who
want to live their lives in political pretense, and discourages
initiative from the more articulate, honest, and sensitive students. The
bounds and style of controversy are delimited before controversy begins.
The university "prepares" the student for "citizenship" through
perpetual rehearsals and, usually, through emasculation of what creative
spirit there is in the individual.

The academic life contains reinforcing counterparts to the way in which
extracurricular life is organized. The academic world is founded on a
teacher-student relations analogous to the parent-child relation which
characterizes *in loco parentis*. Further, academia includes a radical
separation of the student from the material of study. That which is
studies, the social reality, is "objectified" to sterility, dividing the
student from life---just as he is restrained in active involvement by the
deans controlling student government. The specialization of function and
knowledge, admittedly necessary to our complex technological and social
structure, has produced an exaggerated compartmentalization of study and
understanding. This has contributed to an overly parochial view, by
faculty, of the role of its research and scholarship; to a discontinuous
and truncated understanding, by students, of the surrounding social
order; and to a loss of personal attachment, by nearly all, to the worth
of study as a humanistic enterprise.

There is, finally, the cumbersome academic bureaucracy extending
throughout the academic as well as the extracurricular structures,
contributing to the sense of outer complexity and inner powerlessness
that transforms the honest searching of many students to a ratification
of convention and, worse, to a numbness to present and future
catastrophes. The size and financing systems of the university enhance
the permanent trusteeship of the administrative bureaucracy, their power
leading to a shift within the university toward the value standards of
business and the administrative mentality. Huge foundations and other
private financial interests shape the under financed colleges and
universities, making them not only more commercial, but less disposed to
diagnose society critically, less open to dissent. Many social and
physical scientists, neglecting the liberating heritage of higher
learning, develop "human relations" or "morale-producing" techniques for
the corporate economy, while others exercise their intellectual skills
to accelerate the arms race.

Tragically, the university could serve as a significant source of social
criticism and an initiator of new modes and molders of attitudes. But
the actual intellectual effect of the college experience is hardly
distinguishable from that of any other communications channel---say, a
television set---passing on the stock truths of the day. Students leave
college somewhat more "tolerant" than when they arrived, but basically
unchallenged in their values and political orientations. With
administrators ordering the institution, and faculty the curriculum, the
student learns by his isolation to accept elite rule within the
university, which prepares him to accept later forms of minority
control. The real function of the educational system---as opposed to its
more rhetorical function of "searching for truth"---is to impart the key
information and styles that will help the student get by, modestly but
comfortably, in the big society beyond.

The Society Beyond
---------------------------

Look beyond the campus, to America itself. That student life is more
intellectual, and perhaps more comfortable, does not obscure the fact that the
fundamental qualities of life on the campus reflect the habits of society at
large. The fraternity president is seen at the junior manager levels; the
sorority queen has gone to Grosse Pointe;^[Grosse Pointe refers to a wealthy
suburban area of Detroit.] the serious poet burns for a place, any place, to
work; the once-serious and never-serious poets work at the advertising
agencies. The desperation of people threatened by forces about which they know
little and of which they can say less; the cheerful emptiness of people "giving
up" all hope of changing things; the faceless ones polled by Gallup who listed
"international affairs" fourteenth on their list of "problems" but who also
expected thermonuclear war in the next few years; in these and other forms,
Americans are in withdrawal from public life, from any collective effort at
directing their own affairs.

Some regard these national doldrums as a sign of healthy approval of the
established order---but is it approval by consent or manipulated
acquiescence? Others declare that the people are withdrawn because
compelling issues are fast disappearing---perhaps there are fewer bread
lines in America, but is Jim Crow gone, is there enough work and work
more fulfilling, is world war a diminishing threat, and what of the
revolutionary new peoples? Still others think the national quietude is a
necessary consequence of the need for elites to resolve complex and
specialized problems of modern industrial society---but then, why should
*business* elites help decide foreign policy, and who controls the
elites anyway, and are they solving mankind's problems? Others, finally,
shrug knowingly and announce that full democracy never worked anywhere
in the past---but why lump qualitatively different civilizations
together, and how can a social order work well if its best thinkers are
skeptics, and is man really doomed forever to the domination of today?

There are no convincing apologies for the contemporary malaise. While
the world tumbles toward the final war, while men in other nations are
trying desperately to alter events, while the very future qua future is
uncertain---America is without community impulse, without the inner
momentum necessary for an age when societies cannot successfully
perpetuate themselves by their military weapons, when democracy must be
viable because of its quality of life, not its quantity of rockets.

The apathy here is, first, *subjective*---the felt powerlessness of
ordinary people, the resignation before the enormity of events. But
subjective apathy is encouraged by the *objective* American
situation---the actual structural separation of people from power, from
relevant knowledge, from pinnacles of decision-making. Just as the
university influences the student way of life, so do major social
institutions create the circumstances in which the isolated citizen will
try hopelessly to understand his world and himself.

The very isolation of the individual---from power and community and
ability to aspire---means the rise of a democracy without publics. With
the great mass of people structurally remote and psychologically
hesitant with respect to democratic institutions, those institutions
themselves attenuate and become, in the fashion of the vicious circle,
progressively less accessible to those few who aspire to serious
participation in social affairs. The vital democratic connection between
community and leadership, between the mass and the several elites, has
been so wrenched and perverted that disastrous policies go unchallenged
time and again. ...

The University and Social Change
------------------------------------------------

There is perhaps little reason to be optimistic about the above analysis. True,
the Dixiecrat-GOP coalition is the weakest point in the dominating complex of
corporate, military, and political power.^[The "Dixiecrats" refer to
pro-segregation Southern Democrats who broke with the party in the postwar
period and ultimately drifted towards the Republican Party.] But the civil
rights, peace, and student movements are too poor and socially slighted, and
the labor movement too quiescent, to be counted with enthusiasm. From where
else can power and vision be summoned? We believe that the universities are an
overlooked seat of influence.

First, the university is located in a permanent position of social
influence. It's educational function makes it indispensable and
automatically makes it a crucial institution in the formation of social
attitudes. Second, in an unbelievably complicated world, it is the
central institution for organizing, evaluating and transmitting
knowledge. Third, the extent to which academic resources presently are
used to buttress immoral social practice is revealed, first, by the
extent to which defense contracts make the universities engineers of the
arms race. Too, the use of modern social science as a manipulative tool
reveals itself in the "human relations" consultants to the modern
corporations, who introduce trivial sops to give laborers feelings of
"participation" or "belonging," while actually deluding them in order to
further exploit their labor. And, of course, the use of motivational
research is already infamous as a manipulative aspect of American
politics. But these social uses of the universities' resources also
demonstrate the unchangeable reliance by men of power on the men and
storehouses of knowledge: this makes the university functionally tied to
society in new ways, revealing new potentialities, new levers for
change. Fourth, the university is the only mainstream institution that
is open to participation by individuals of nearly any viewpoint.

These, at least, are facts, no matter how dull the teaching, how
paternalistic the rules, how irrelevant the research that goes on.
Social relevance, the accessibility to knowledge, and internal
openness---these together make the university a potential base and agency
in a movement of social change.

1.  Any new left^[Partly because of this phrase, organizations like SDS came to
    refer to themselves, and are now referred to by historians, as the New
    Left.] in America must be, in large measure, a left with real intellectual
    skills, committed to deliberativeness, honesty, reflection as working
    tools. The university permits the political life to be an adjunct to the
    academic one, and action to be informed by reason.

2.  A new left must be distributed in significant social roles
    throughout the country. The universities are distributed in such a
    manner.

3.  A new left must consist of younger people who matured in the postwar
    world, and partially be directed to the recruitment of younger
    people. The university is an obvious beginning point.

4.  A new left must include liberals and socialists, the former for
    their relevance, the latter for their sense of thoroughgoing reforms
    in the system. The university is a more sensible place than a
    political party for these two traditions to begin to discuss their
    differences and look for political synthesis.

5.  A new left must start controversy across the land, if national
    policies and national apathy are to be reversed. The ideal
    university is a community of controversy, within itself and in its
    effects on communities beyond.

6.  A new left must transform modern complexity into issues that can be
    understood and felt close up by every human being. It must give form
    to the feelings of helplessness and indifference, so that people may
    see the political, social, and economic sources of their private
    troubles, and organize to change society. In a time of supposed
    prosperity, moral complacency, and political manipulation, a new
    left cannot rely on only aching stomachs to be the engine force of
    social reform. The case for change, for alternatives that will
    involve uncomfortable personal efforts, must be argued as never
    before. The university is a relevant place for all of these
    activities.

But we need not indulge in illusions: the university system cannot
complete a movement of ordinary people making demands for a better life.
From its schools and colleges across the nation, a militant left might
awaken its allies, and by beginning the process towards peace, civil
rights, and labor struggles, reinsert theory and idealism where too
often reign confusion and political barter. The power of students and
faculty united is not only potential; it has shown its actuality in the
South, and in the reform movements of the North.

The bridge to political power, though, will be build through genuine
cooperation, locally, nationally, and internationally, between a new
left of young people and an awakening community of allies. In each
community we must look within the university and act with confidence
that we can be powerful, but we must look outwards to the less exotic
but more lasting struggles for justice.

To turn these mythic possibilities into realities will involve national
efforts at university reform by an alliance of students and faculty.
They must wrest control of the educational process from the
administrative bureaucracy. They must make fraternal and functional
contact with allies in labor, civil rights, and other liberal forces
outside the campus. They must import major public issues into the
curriculum---research and teaching on problems of war and peace is an
outstanding example. They must make debate and controversy, not dull
pedantic cant, the common style for educational life. They must
consciously build a base for their assault upon the loci of power.

As students for a democratic society, we are committed to stimulating
this kind of social movement, this kind of vision and program in campus
and community across the country. If we appear to seek the unattainable,
as it has been said, then let it be known that we do so to avoid the
unimaginable.
